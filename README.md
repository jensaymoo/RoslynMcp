## What It Is

RoslynMcp is a .NET 8 application that exposes the power of [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) (the .NET compiler platform) through the MCP protocol. It acts as a bridge between AI assistants and your C# codebase, enabling deep code understanding and analysis.

## Why It Exists

Traditional AI code assistants often rely on simplistic pattern matching (grep/glob) which misses semantic context. RoslynMcp solves this by providing:

- **Semantic understanding** — It knows what your code *means*, not just what it *says*
- **Symbol resolution** — Understands types, methods, properties across your entire solution
- **Call graph tracing** — See how code flows through your system
- **Code smell detection** — Identifies potential issues using [Roslynator](https://github.com/dotnet/roslynator) analyzers

## Public MCP API

These tool descriptions are written as routing triggers. Use them to help an agent decide which tool to call based on the user's intent.


### `load_solution`

Use this tool when you need to start working with a .NET solution and no solution has been loaded yet. This must be the first tool called in a session before any code analysis or navigation tools can be used. The result now includes a readiness state so fresh or detached worktrees can be reported as degraded_missing_artifacts or degraded_restore_recommended instead of leaving users to infer that from diagnostics alone.

Parameters:
- `solutionHintPath` (optional): Absolute path to a `.sln` file, or to a directory used as the recursive discovery root for `.sln`/`.slnx` files. If omitted, the tool will auto-detect from the current workspace.


### `understand_codebase`

Use this tool when you need a quick overview of the codebase structure at the start of a session. It returns the project structure with dependency relationships and identifies hotspots from hand-written source by default so generated/intermediate artifacts do not dominate the initial view.

Parameters:
- `profile` (optional): Analysis depth. `quick` for fast results, `standard` for balanced output, `deep` for thorough analysis. Defaults to `standard`.


### `list_dependencies`

Use this tool when you need to understand how projects relate to each other within a solution. It shows the dependency graph between projects, indicating which projects depend on which others. For automation, prefer projectPath as the stable selector; projectId is snapshot-local to the active workspace snapshot.

Parameters:
- `projectPath` (optional): Exact path to a project file (`.csproj`). This is the recommended stable selector for automation. Specify only one of `projectPath`, `projectName`, or `projectId`.
- `projectName` (optional): Name of a project. Specify only one of `projectPath`, `projectName`, or `projectId`.
- `projectId` (optional): Project identifier from the current `load_solution` workspace snapshot. It is snapshot-local and can change after reload, so prefer `projectPath` for automation. Specify only one of `projectPath`, `projectName`, or `projectId`.
- `direction` (optional): Which direction of dependencies to return. `outgoing` shows what the selected project depends on. `incoming` shows what depends on the selected project. `both` returns both directions. Defaults to `both`.


### `list_types`

Use this tool when you need to list types declared in a specific loaded project. It is useful for project-scoped discovery and for finding type symbols by name before calling tools like `list_members`, `resolve_symbol`, or `get_type_hierarchy`. For automation, prefer projectPath as the stable selector; projectId is snapshot-local to the active workspace snapshot. Results prefer handwritten declarations by default and now report source bias, completeness, and degraded discovery hints.

Parameters:
- `projectPath` (optional): Exact path to a project file (`.csproj`). This is the recommended stable selector for automation. Specify only one of `projectPath`, `projectName`, or `projectId`.
- `projectName` (optional): Name of a project. Specify only one of `projectPath`, `projectName`, or `projectId`.
- `projectId` (optional): Project identifier from the current `load_solution` workspace snapshot. It is snapshot-local and can change after reload, so prefer `projectPath` for automation. Specify only one of `projectPath`, `projectName`, or `projectId`.
- `namespacePrefix` (optional): Filter to only types in namespaces starting with this prefix.
- `kind` (optional): Filter by type kind: `class`, `record`, `interface`, `enum`, or `struct`.
- `accessibility` (optional): Filter by accessibility: `public`, `internal`, `protected`, `private`, `protected_internal`, or `private_protected`.
- `limit` (optional): Maximum number of results to return. Defaults to `100`, maximum `500`.
- `offset` (optional): Number of results to skip for pagination. Defaults to `0`.


### `list_members`

Use this tool when you need to inspect the members declared by a specific type. It returns methods, properties, fields, events, and constructors, and supports filtering by kind, accessibility, binding, inheritance, and pagination so you can keep results focused.

Parameters:
- `typeSymbolId` (optional): The stable symbol ID of a type, obtained from `list_types`. Provide this OR `path`+`line`+`column`.
- `path` (optional): Path to a source file. Provide this together with `line` and `column` instead of `typeSymbolId`.
- `line` (optional): Line number (1-based) pointing to a type in the source file.
- `column` (optional): Column number (1-based) pointing to a type in the source file.
- `kind` (optional): Filter by member kind: `method`, `property`, `field`, `event`, or `ctor`.
- `accessibility` (optional): Filter by accessibility: `public`, `internal`, `protected`, `private`, `protected_internal`, or `private_protected`.
- `binding` (optional): Filter by binding type: `static` or `instance`.
- `includeInherited` (optional): When `true`, includes members from base classes. Defaults to `false`.
- `limit` (optional): Maximum number of results to return. Defaults to `100`, maximum `500`.
- `offset` (optional): Number of results to skip for pagination. Defaults to `0`.


### `resolve_symbol`

Use this tool when you have a source position (`path` + `line` + `column`), a qualified symbol name, or an existing `symbolId` and need the stable `symbolId` plus declaration location used by other navigation tools. This is often the first step before calling `explain_symbol`, `trace_call_flow`, `find_callers`, or `find_usages`. Qualified-name lookup can search the whole loaded solution, but `projectPath` is the preferred stable disambiguator for automation.

Parameters:
- `symbolId` (optional): An existing symbol ID to look up. Provide this OR `path`+`line`+`column` OR `qualifiedName`.
- `path` (optional): Path to a source file. Provide this together with `line` and `column` instead of `symbolId` or `qualifiedName`.
- `line` (optional): Line number (1-based) in the source file.
- `column` (optional): Column number (1-based) in the source file.
- `qualifiedName` (optional): A fully qualified or short type/member name (e.g., `System.String`, `MyNamespace.MyType.MyMethod`, or `MyMethod`). Provide this instead of `symbolId` or `path`+`line`+`column`.
- `projectPath` (optional): Optional project scope for `qualifiedName` lookup — path to a project that contains the symbol. This is the preferred stable selector for automation.
- `projectName` (optional): Optional project scope for `qualifiedName` lookup — name of a project that contains the symbol. Use this to narrow ambiguous matches.
- `projectId` (optional): Optional project scope for `qualifiedName` lookup — project ID from the current `load_solution` workspace snapshot. It is snapshot-local and can change after reload, so prefer `projectPath` when you need a durable selector.


### `resolve_symbols`

Use this tool when you need to resolve multiple symbols in one round-trip. Each entry reuses resolve_symbol semantics, including symbolId, source position, qualifiedName lookup, project scoping, readable symbol references, and structured ambiguity results.

Parameters:
- `entries` (required): The symbols to resolve. Each entry supports the same selector modes as resolve_symbol: symbolId, path+line+column, or qualifiedName with optional project scoping.


### `explain_symbol`

Use this tool when you need to understand what a specific symbol (type, method, property, field, etc.) does, what its signature looks like, and where it is used in the codebase. It provides a human-readable explanation along with impact hints showing areas with high reference density.

Parameters:
- `symbolId` (optional): The stable symbol ID, obtained from `resolve_symbol`, `list_types`, or `list_members`. Provide this OR `path`+`line`+`column`.
- `path` (optional): Path to a source file. Provide this together with `line` and `column` instead of `symbolId`.
- `line` (optional): Line number (1-based) pointing to the symbol in the source file.
- `column` (optional): Column number (1-based) pointing to the symbol in the source file.


### `trace_call_flow`

Use this tool when you need to understand how code flows through your system — either finding what calls a specific symbol (upstream) or what a symbol calls (downstream). This is essential for debugging, impact analysis, and understanding architectural patterns. Results prefer hand-written source by default so generated/intermediate call edges do not overwhelm interactive traces, and transition labels now degrade explicitly to unresolved_project/project_inference_degraded when attribution is uncertain. Set includePossibleTargets=true to receive a deliberate possible-runtime-target edge set for uncertain polymorphic dispatch.

Parameters:
- `symbolId` (optional): The stable symbol ID, obtained from `resolve_symbol`, `list_types`, or `list_members`. Provide this OR `path`+`line`+`column`.
- `path` (optional): Path to a source file. Provide this together with `line` and `column` instead of `symbolId`.
- `line` (optional): Line number (1-based) pointing to the symbol in the source file.
- `column` (optional): Column number (1-based) pointing to the symbol in the source file.
- `direction` (optional): Which direction to trace. `upstream` finds callers (who uses this). `downstream` finds callees (what this calls). `both` returns both directions. Defaults to `both`.
- `depth` (optional): How many levels of the call chain to traverse. Defaults to `2`. Use larger values for deeper analysis. `null` behaves the same as omitting the parameter.
- `includePossibleTargets` (optional): When true, also returns possible-runtime-target edges for uncertain interface or polymorphic dispatch. Direct static edges remain separate in the main edge list.


### `find_callers`

Use this tool when you need only the immediate direct upstream callers of a symbol. This is a focused wrapper around call-flow tracing and does not traverse beyond one caller level.

Parameters:
- `symbolId` (optional): The stable symbol ID, obtained from `resolve_symbol`, `list_types`, or `list_members`, for the symbol whose immediate direct callers you want to inspect.


### `find_usages`

Use this tool when you need to find source-code references to a specific symbol across a document, project, or the entire solution. This is critical before refactoring or modifying a symbol to understand its static impact, but it may not include dynamic, reflection-based, or string-based usages.

Parameters:
- `symbolId` (required): The stable symbol ID, obtained from `resolve_symbol`, `list_types`, or `list_members`.
- `scope` (optional): The search scope. `project` searches only within the containing project. `solution` searches the entire solution. Defaults to `solution`.
- `path` (optional): Required when scope=document: the file path to search within.


### `find_implementations`

Use this tool when you need to find concrete implementations of an interface or abstract type, and overrides or implementations of abstract/virtual members. This is essential for understanding static polymorphic targets in the loaded solution before refactoring or changing a contract.
    
Parameters:
- `symbolId` (required): The stable symbol ID of an interface, abstract type, or abstract/virtual member, obtained from `resolve_symbol`, `list_types`, or `list_members`.


### `get_type_hierarchy`

Use this tool when you need to inspect a type's inheritance relationships: base types, implemented interfaces, and derived types. Use `includeTransitive=false` for immediate parents and children only, or `true` to expand the full transitive hierarchy.

Parameters:
- `symbolId` (required): The stable symbol ID of a type, obtained from `resolve_symbol`, `list_types`, or `list_members`. Must resolve to a type (class, interface, enum, struct, or record).
- `includeTransitive` (optional): When `true` (default), includes all transitive base types and all derived types. When `false`, returns only immediate parents and children.
- `maxDerived` (optional): Maximum number of derived types to return. Defaults to `200`. Higher values may impact performance.


### `find_codesmells`

Use this tool when you need to check a specific file for potential code quality issues. It runs Roslyn-based static analysis to detect common problems such as dead code, performance anti-patterns, naming violations, and other code smells identified by Roslynator analyzers. Optional filters operate on stable normalized risk levels (low, review_required, high, info) and categories (analyzer, correctness, design, maintainability, performance, style) in deterministic stream order. reviewMode=conservative favors stronger review signals over low-noise style and trivia suggestions.

Parameters:
- `path` (required): Path to the source file to analyze. The file must exist in the currently loaded solution.
- `maxFindings` (optional): Maximum number of accepted findings to return. When provided, discovery stops as soon as this many matching findings are found.
- `riskLevels` (optional): Accepted risk levels to include. Use normalized result values such as low, review_required, high, or info.
- `categories` (optional): Accepted categories to include. Use normalized values: analyzer, correctness, design, maintainability, performance, or style. When omitted or empty, all categories are included.
- `reviewMode` (optional): Review ranking mode. Use 'default' for the existing stream or 'conservative' to suppress lightweight style/trivia noise when stronger issues are present.


### `rename_symbol`

Use this tool when you need to rename a symbol (type, method, property, field, parameter, local variable, etc.) across the entire solution. This performs a safe refactoring that updates all references to the symbol. Returns the list of changed files.

Parameters:
- `symbolId` (required): The symbol ID of the symbol to rename. Use 'resolve_symbol' to obtain this if needed.
- `newName` (required): The new name for the symbol. Must be a valid C# identifier and should not conflict with existing symbols in the same scope.


### `format_document`

Use this tool when you need to format exactly one C# source file in the loaded solution using the solution's current formatting and style settings. Returns whether formatting changes were applied and persisted.

Parameters:
- `path` (required): The path to the C# source file to format. The file must be part of the currently loaded solution.
